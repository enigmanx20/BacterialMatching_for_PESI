#Bacterial Matching Program for PESI-2020 data format
This is a program for bacterial identification for mass spectra obtained from PESI. PESI (probe electrospray ionization) is a new ionization technique invented in Yamanashi University. Alike ESI (electrospray ionization), PESI ionize sample by as high voltage as 3kV. 

PESI is unique for taking sample by a fine needle, which is fine enough to minimize sample damage. Furthermore, PESI is more tolerant to salt or other mixtures of chemicals. This is a great advantage for biological material. Readers interested in PESI will be satisfied to read papers in reference. 

##Let's begin
To start bacterial matching, you need PESI data exported from LabSolutions. If you have any, just run the python script. If you have none, just ask me.
Please contact me on GitHub if you have any questions or requests.
